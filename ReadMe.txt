1. Please download the dataset from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html 
2. Please use download stopword list from http://www.ranks.nl/stopwords and save it as "Long Stopword List.txt"
   (I have included text file "Long Stopword List.txt" along with my submission)
3. Run the python file TextClustering.py
4. It produces two output filesnamely:
   - 'top_500.txt' (Top 500 words + counts for these words)
   - 'CentroidTopWords.txt' (each row represents each cluster)
